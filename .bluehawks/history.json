Let me check what files are actually available in the `src` directory to better understand the project structure.\n\nI see that the `src` directory contains the following items:\n\n- `cli/`\n- `config/`\n- `core/`\n- `index.ts`\n\nThe `client.ts` file doesn't exist in the project. The project appears to have an `index.ts` file instead, which might be the main entry point for the application.\n\nWould you like me to check the contents of the `index.ts` file instead, or do you have a different file in mind?"
