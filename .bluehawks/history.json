The available files are:\n\n- `README.md`\n- `package-lock.json`\n- `package.json`\n- `tsconfig.json`\n- `vitest.config.ts`\n- A `src` directory (which may contain source code)\n\nSince there's no `client.ts` file in the listed files, I can't describe what it does. It's possible that:\n\n1. The file exists in a subdirectory of `src`\n2. It was created after the current directory listing was generated\n3. It's a file that wasn't included in the current context\n\nTo help you further, I'd need to either:\n- Check if `client.ts` exists in the `src` directory\n- Provide more context about your project structure\n\nWould you like me to search for `client.ts` in the project?"
