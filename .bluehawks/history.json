      "content": "I'll check the content of client.ts for you. Since I don't see a file named client.ts in the current directory structure, I'll search for it first.\n\nI found two files named client.ts. Let me check the content of the most likely one - src/core/api/client.ts, which seems to be the primary API client file.\n\nThe content of `src/core/api/client.ts` is a comprehensive API client implementation for Bluehawks CLI. Here's a summary of its key features:\n\n## Overview\nThis file implements an OpenAI-compatible API client with streaming support, handling chat completions, embeddings, and reranking operations.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Configuration Management**\n   - Uses environment variables and constants for API settings\n   - Supports configurable base URL, API key, model, and timeout settings\n\n2. **Core Functionality**\n   - `createChatCompletion()`: Non-streaming chat completions with tool support\n   - `createStreamingChatCompletion()`: Streaming chat completions with proper chunk handling\n   - `createEmbeddings()`: Generates text embeddings\n   - `rerank()`: Reranks documents based on query relevance\n\n3. **Qwen3 Tool Call Parsing**\n   - Special handling for Qwen3's native tool call format (using `<tool_call>` markup)\n   - Parses tool calls from text content when standard JSON format isn't present\n\n4. **Error Handling & Retries**\n   - Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff\n   - Timeout handling and proper error reporting\n   - Comprehensive error types with status codes and messages\n\n5. **Streaming Support**\n   - Implements proper streaming chunk processing with delta content and tool calls\n   - Handles tool call updates incrementally during streaming\n\n6. **Tool Integration**\n   - Supports tool definitions and tool choice parameters\n   - Provides methods to send tool results back to the API\n\n7. **Singleton Pattern**\n   - Exports a global `apiClient` instance for easy access\n\nThe client is designed to be flexible, supporting various LLM backends while maintaining compatibility with OpenAI's API specification. It includes robust error handling, timeout management, and special handling for different tool call formats."
