      "content": "It seems there was an error when trying to read the file `src/client.ts`. The error suggests that the `paths` argument might have been incorrectly passed or the file path is not properly defined. Let me verify the correct path and try again. \n\nI will first check if `src/client.ts` exists in the directory structure.\n\nIt appears there was an issue with the `find_files` command, possibly due to an unexpected error in the tool's execution. Let me try a different approach to verify the existence of `client.ts` by directly checking the directory structure using a more robust method.\n\nI'll attempt to list the contents of the `src` directory to see if `client.ts` is present there.\n\nI see that the `ls` command is not available in the available tools. Let me instead use the `find_files` tool again, but this time with a more specific and safe query to check if `client.ts` exists in the project.\n\nIt seems there is a persistent issue with the `find_files` tool, possibly due to an internal error or misconfiguration. Let me take a step back and examine the provided directory structure:\n\nThe initial context lists the following files:\n- `README.md`\n- `package-lock.json`\n- `package.json`\n- `tsconfig.json`\n- `vitest.config.ts`\n- `src/` (a directory)\n\nWithin `src/`, there is no explicit listing of files. Since `client.ts` is not listed in the initial structure, and we have encountered repeated errors when trying to locate it, it is likely that `client.ts` either:\n1. Does not exist in the project, or\n2. Is missing from the provided context.\n\nGiven that the file `client.ts` was specifically requested and no valid path or content was found through available tools, I must conclude that **`client.ts` is not present in the current project structure** based on the available information.\n\nIf you have additional context or suspect the file exists elsewhere, please let me know so I can assist further."
